# Planting List – The Folly View Nook

## Climbers (for trellis/arbor and to soften boundaries)
Rosa 'Zéphirine Drouhin' – Thornless Bourbon rose, rich pink, intensely fragrant, repeat‑flowering
Clematis 'Prince Charles' – Small‑flowered clematis, pale lavender, can intertwine with rose for extended bloom

## Perennial Borders (for fragrance and structure)
Lavandula angustifolia 'Hidcote' – Compact English lavender, deep purple flowers, highly aromatic
Nepeta × faassenii 'Walker's Low' – Catmint, soft grey‑green foliage, lavender‑blue flowers, long blooming
Salvia nemorosa 'Caradonna' – Upright violet‑blue spikes, attracts bees, adds vertical accent

## Ground Layer (between stepping stones and under bench)
Thymus serpyllum 'Elfin' – Creeping thyme, tiny leaves, pink flowers in summer, drought‑tolerant
Thymus pseudolanuginosus (Woolly thyme) – Silvery‑grey, fuzzy foliage, forms a soft mat

## Folly Adornment (to age the structure)
Hedera helix (English ivy) – Allow to climb sparingly on folly for a weathered look
Parietaria judaica (Pellitory‑of‑the‑wall) – A delicate wall‑dwelling plant that suggests antiquity

## Seasonal Accents (in pots or small pockets)
Cyclamen hederifolium – Autumn‑flowering, marbled leaves, for late colour
Galanthus nivalis (Snowdrop) – Early spring, planted in drifts around the folly base

## Notes
*   All plants are suited to temperate climates (USDA zones 5‑8) and prefer well‑drained soil.
*   Rosa 'Zéphirine Drouhin' is prone to black spot; site in good air circulation and avoid overhead watering.
*   Lavender and thyme require full sun; the nook should receive at least 6 hours of direct sunlight.
*   The ivy should be trimmed annually to prevent it from overwhelming the folly’s detail.
