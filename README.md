# Romantic Tea Gardens

A curated collection of design blueprints for small, romantic garden spaces, or "nooks," specifically designed for the contemplation and enjoyment of afternoon tea.

## Design Philosophy

This project blends traditional English landscape garden elements with modern sensibilities, creating timeless yet contemporary spaces. Each design incorporates:

*   **Romantic Narratives:** Every nook tells a story, inspired by historical garden traditions like 18th‑century "eye‑catchers" and picturesque movements.
*   **Sensory Engagement:** Designs prioritize fragrance, texture, and seasonal interest to enhance the tea‑time experience.
*   **Practical Elegance:** Spaces are both beautiful and functional, with consideration for seating, circulation, and the practicalities of serving tea.
*   **Ecological Thought:** Planting schemes favor sustainable, pollinator‑friendly species that thrive in temperate climates.

## Repository Structure

Each garden nook design resides in its own directory (e.g., `the-folly-view/`) containing:

*   `concept.md` – The romantic narrative, historical inspiration, and intended visitor experience.
*   `planting_list.txt` – A plain‑text list of key plant species, organized by function.
*   `layout.svg` – A simple top‑down schematic showing the arrangement of hardscape and planting areas.

## Contribution Guidelines

We welcome proposals for new garden nooks that align with the project’s philosophy. The workflow is as follows:

1.  **Proposal:** Open a new Issue titled "Proposal: [Design Name] Nook." Describe the concept, key elements, and romantic inspiration. Label it `enhancement` and `proposal`.
2.  **Development:** Once the proposal is accepted, create a feature branch (`feature/[design-name]-nook`), add the three required files in a dedicated directory, and commit your work.
3.  **Review:** Open a Pull Request from your feature branch to `main`. Link the original issue and summarize the design. A project maintainer will review the files, paying special attention to narrative coherence, plant suitability, and layout clarity.
4.  **Merge:** After review and any necessary revisions, the PR will be squash‑merged into `main`. The design then becomes part of the official collection.
5.  **Release:** Periodically, approved designs are gathered into a versioned release (e.g., `v1.0.0`) and published in the repository’s Releases section.
